# FM Radio Capture Project

## Introduction

This project involves a setup created using GNU Radio and a Software Defined Radio (SDR) tool to capture FM radio signals. The system is designed to tune into various FM radio frequencies and adjust the gain accordingly. It's an exciting project for anyone interested in radio frequencies, SDR, or GNU Radio applications.

## Requirements

- GNU Radio 3.10.8.0 or higher
- Python 3
- PyQt5
- OsmoSDR

## Installation

1. Install GNU Radio and the required dependencies.
2. Ensure Python 3 and PyQt5 are installed on your system.
3. Clone this repository or download the provided `.grc` file.

## Usage

Execute the `.grc` file with GNU Radio. This will generate a Python script (`get_FM.py`). Run this script to start the FM radio capture or execute the `.grc` in gnuradio:

```bash
python get_FM.py
